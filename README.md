**Basic Data Description**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million lives lost each year, which represents 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of
five CVD-related deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in individuals under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs,
and this dataset contains 12 variables that can be used to predict potential heart disease. Individuals with cardiovascular diseases or at high risk of cardiovascular diseases (due to the presence of
one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or an established disease)
require early detection and management.
